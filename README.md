# Carro-iOS-test

## iOS Engineer

### Background

In Carro, we are often required to build mobile apps backed by internal data APIs to communicate critical and relevant information to our stakeholders and consumers.

### Your Task

Build an iOS app to display vehicle information base on user's country. 

Please fetch the data from https://gist.githubusercontent.com/heinhtetaung92/fbfd371881e6982c71971eedd5732798/raw/00e14e0e5502dbcf1ea9a2cdc44324fd3a5492e7/test.json and display it accordingly to design.

Before display the UI, user must be able to choose options for the country.

Please refer to the design below for singapore UI.
For thailand, there'll be a few changes. 
1. Remove "customize your insurance" button
2. Remove "View Docs" button
3. Remove "Usage based insurance" information
4. Remove "Named drivers" information
5. Add "Total Fines" information
6. Add "Total Fines Amount" information

Regarding "Enhance your subscripton" articles, please use hard coded information. 

You may use appropiate images and icons. They don't need to be exactly same.

### Country Options
1. Singapore
2. Thailand

We will evaluate this exercise based on:

- Completion of the application
- User Interface
- Code Structure
- Tests

You may use any Testing framework of your choice to write the unit tests.

### Constraints

#### Time

7 days from this task is given. Please feel free to submit your work any time, before the deadline.

Please timebox yourself to a maximum of 8 hours for this activity.

#### Technology

You are required to use Swift.

#### Testing

Please approach this exercise as you would in your day-to-day development workflow.

If you write tests in your daily work, we would love to see them in this exercise too.

#### Git and Commit History

Sync your app to GitHub and allow access to `heinhtetaung92`, `nyan-lin-tun` and `cokuscz`.

Please maintain a descriptive and clear Git commit history as it would allow us to better understand your thought process.

### Follow Up

In the event that you are selected for the next round of interview (onsite chat),
please be expected to discuss your work further with us during the interview.

Looking forward to seeing your code!
